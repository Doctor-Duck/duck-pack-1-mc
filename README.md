# Duck Pack Remake - Back to Where it All Began!
Duck Pack Remake is a kitchen sink modpack that is a remake of the original Duck Pack modpack that was made in late 2020.

Duck Pack originally started as a modpack project for me and my friends but has now turned into a series of modpacks for different major versions of Minecraft. After working on so many modpacks, I thought it was time to go back and remake my original modpack from the ground up. I was also feeling nostalgic for 1.12.2 mods, so it really helped inspire me to remake the original Duck Pack.

# What's So Different from the Original Duck Pack?
Firstly, there are lots of new mods! Duck Pack Remake adds 85+ new mods that were not seen in the original Duck Pack. Most of these new mods are addons to mods such as Thaumcraft, Electroblob's Wizardry, Botania, Blood Magic, and Tinker's Construct. But there are also plenty of other new mods that were not in the original Duck Pack either, such as Advanced Rocketry, Oh the Biomes You'll Go, Simple Voice Chat, and many more. There are also quests, loads of updated mods from the original Duck Pack, and lots of performance improvements!

With lots of tech, magic, exploration, and loads of quests to do, there is a little something for everyone to enjoy!
